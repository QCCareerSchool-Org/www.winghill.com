It was hard to find a college that does certification that focuses only on (Events, Weddings, or Floral Design.) Thanks to QC Events School, I was able to get certified in all three areas that I was looking.',

This particular course had me thinking outside the box, thinking of unique ways to stay within a budget, incorporating the clients interests into their theme. I love how thorough the course is and the communication through the school is fantastic! I now have two weddings booked for 2025! Thank you QC Events!!',

    reviewText: 'I began with the Event Planning program and loved it. Sure it is easy to just start planning  wedding and events; however, taking this course really teaches you everything you need to know about planning. I decided to follow up my services with taking an event decor and floral designing course. I recommend this online program to anyone thinking of going into this field. Take as much time as you need to complete the courses (within 3 years), the assignments are really in depth and the your assigned tutor is available to answer any questions that one might have.',

From doing local research, personal touches on what you would do in situations for the assignments to the tutor being very personable with me through my whole learning experience. With this being an online learning school there are many options to reach out to your tutor, any staff either through email, calling and even through the social media for any help that you need was amazing. And having that connection with the other students in the social media page is amazing! I am already looking forward to starting this next chapter of my life in doing something that I love and doing more courses through QC to enhance my career as well!',
